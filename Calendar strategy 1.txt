TODOS
Calendar formatting
- Is String formatter easier than current formatting method?
- improve variable names!!!	

1) startDay:
	- day
	- startingDayValue
	- startingDayNumber
2) dayOfWeekValue 
	- weekdayNumber
3) dayOfWeekName:
	- weekdayName

- Print month name, not month number
- Let user enter day, month and year separately?
	- How to check if format is correct?

- Put user prompt in separate function. Call functions (getDate and createCalendar) as long as user does not cancel.
